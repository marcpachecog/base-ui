# Support

<p class="description">Learn how to get support for Base¬†UI components, including feature requests, bug fixes, and technical support from the team.</p>

## GitHub

We use GitHub issues as a bug and feature request tracker.

If you think you've found a bug, or you have a new feature idea:

1. Please start by [making sure it hasn't already been reported or fixed](https://github.com/mui/base-ui/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aclosed).
   You can search through existing issues and pull requests to see if someone has reported one similar to yours.
2. Then, if no duplicates exist, [open an issue](https://github.com/mui/base-ui/issues/new/choose) in the Base¬†UI repository.

### New issue guidelines

- Please follow one the issue templates provided on GitHub.
- Please begin the title with "[component-name]" (if relevant), and use a succinct description that helps others find similar issues.
  - ‚ùå _"It doesn't work"_
  - ‚úÖ _"[button] Add support for {{new feature}}"_
- Please don't group multiple topics in one issue.
- Please don't comment "+1" on an issue. It spams the maintainers and doesn't help move the issue forward. Use GitHub reactions instead (üëç).

### Bug reproductions

We require bug reports to be accompanied by a **minimal reproduction**.
It significantly increases the odds of fixing the problem.
You have a few possible options to provide it:

#### Use the live editors

You can browse the documentation, find an example close to your use case, and then open it in a live editor:

<a href="/base-ui/react-button/#introduction">
<span class="only-light-mode">
<img src="/static/docs-infra/forking-an-example.png" alt="Forking an example" loading="lazy" width="1628" height="700" style="display: block; max-width: 774px;">
</span>
<span class="only-dark-mode">
<img src="/static/docs-infra/forking-an-example-dark.png" alt="Forking an example" loading="lazy" width="1628" height="700" style="display: block; max-width: 774px;">
</span>
</a>

#### Use starter templates

You can use a starter React template to build a reproduction case with [JavaScript](https://stackblitz.com/github/stackblitz/starters/tree/main/react) or [TypeScript](https://stackblitz.com/github/stackblitz/starters/tree/main/react-ts).

## Stack¬†Overflow

We use Stack¬†Overflow for how-to questions. Answers are crowdsourced from expert developers in the Base¬†UI community as well as Base¬†UI maintainers.

You can search through existing questions and answers to see if someone has asked a similar question using the [base-ui tags](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/base-ui):

If you can't find your answer, [ask a new question](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/ask?tags=reactjs%20base-ui) using the relevant tags.

## Long-term support (LTS)

Bug fixes, performance enhancements, and other improvements are delivered in new releases.
However, we remain committed to providing security updates and addressing regressions for the immediate predecessor of the current major version.

This includes issues introduced by external sources, like browser upgrades or changes to upstream dependencies.

### Supported versions

- Base¬†UI v1: ‚ö†Ô∏è Alpha version.
