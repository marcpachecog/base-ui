# Overview

<p class="description">Base UI is an unstyled UI component library for building accessible user interfaces while maintaing complete control over styling.</p>

## Introduction

Our goal with Base UI is to provide a complete set of accessible UI components but with maximum flexibility. We want to facilitate creative user interfaces and help teams ship high-quality products.

Base UI components are React-based, are built by the same team that created [Material UI](https://mui.com/material-ui/), and feature the same robust engineering but without any styling.

With Base UI, you can rapidly build on top of our foundational components using any styling or animation solution you choose.

:::info
Base UI is currently in alpha.

We're adding new components and features regularly, and you're welcome to contribute!

Look for the [open issues](https://github.com/mui/base-ui/issues) and [pull requests](https://github.com/mui/base-ui/pulls) in the `mui/base-ui` repository on GitHub to see what other community members are working on, and feel free to submit your own.

## Advantages of Base UI

- **Ship faster:** Base UI provides the foundational building blocks you need to assemble a sleek and accessible user interface in a fraction of the time that it would take to do it all from scratch.
- **You own the CSS:** Base UI has no built-in styling solution, and ships zero presentational styles. You maintain total control over your styling layer.
- **Accessibility:** Base UI components adhere to WAI-ARIA patterns and are tested across a range of browsers, platforms, devices, and input mechanisms.

## Base UI vs. Material UI

Unlike Material UI, Base UI does not include any default theme or built-in style engine.
This makes it a great choice if you need complete control over how your app's CSS is implemented.

Future versions of Material UI will gradually adopt Base UI as its foundation.
